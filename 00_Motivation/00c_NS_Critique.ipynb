This notebook takes the next crucial step: to explicitly construct a Local Navier-Stokes (LNS) system as a first-order system of partial differential equations. We will write down the complete set of equations for the chosen state vector, analyze its structure, and briefly touch upon consistency, symmetries, and the concept of conserved currents within this extended framework."

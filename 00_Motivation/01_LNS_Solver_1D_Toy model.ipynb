        "Following the theoretical groundwork laid in Notebooks 0a-0c, this notebook transitions to the practical implementation of a solver for a simplified Local Navier-Stokes (LNS) system. We will focus on a 1D compressible flow scenario to illustrate the core numerical techniques. The primary goals are:\n",
        "1.  Define the 1D LNS system equations and state vector.\n",
        "2.  Implement functions for flux and source term calculations.\n",
        "3.  Develop a Finite Volume Method (FVM) solver using a basic numerical flux (e.g., Lax-Friedrichs) and explicit time stepping.\n",
        "4.  Test the solver with a canonical problem, such as the propagation of a thermal pulse, to observe wave-like behavior due to finite relaxation times.\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation will serve as a foundation for understanding the numerical challenges and characteristics of LNS systems before considering more complex 2D/3D scenarios or advanced numerical schemes."

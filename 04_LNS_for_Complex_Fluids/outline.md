### **Plan Outline 1: Notebook Series on LNS for Non-Newtonian and Complex Fluids**

**Series Title:** `LNS for Complex Fluids: From Viscoelasticity to Multi-Phase Flows`

**Core Hypothesis:** The Local Navier-Stokes (LNS) framework, which was developed from first principles to ensure locality, is not just a correction for simple fluids in extreme regimes but is the *natural and necessary starting point* for describing non-Newtonian and complex fluids where memory effects (viscoelasticity) are dominant, not exceptional.

**Notebook 1: The Failure of N-S and the Natural Fit of LNS for Viscoelasticity**
*   **1. Introduction: What is a Non-Newtonian Fluid?**
    *   Defining shear-thinning, shear-thickening, and viscoelasticity (e.g., polymers, gels, slurries).
    *   Showcasing phenomena impossible to capture with N-S: Weissenberg effect (rod-climbing), die swell, elastic turbulence.
*   **2. The Inadequacy of Classical N-S:**
    *   Demonstrate how the linear, instantaneous stress-strain relation of N-S completely fails to model memory.
    *   Discuss the limitations of generalized Newtonian models (which only capture shear-rate-dependent viscosity but not elasticity).
*   **3. The LNS Stress Equation as a Constitutive Model:**
    *   Re-introduce the LNS evolution equation for stress: $\tau_\sigma \frac{\mathcal{D}_\sigma \mathbf{\sigma}'}{\mathcal{D} t} + \mathbf{\sigma}' = \mathbf{\sigma}'_{NSF}$.
    *   **Key Insight:** For complex fluids, this is not a correction but the *fundamental constitutive equation*. $\tau_\sigma$ is no longer a tiny parameter but a dominant material property (the Maxwell relaxation time).
*   **4. Exploring Different Objective Derivatives and Non-linear Terms:**
    *   Introduce more sophisticated models beyond the simple UCM (Upper Convected Maxwell) model:
        *   **Oldroyd-B Model:** For dilute polymer solutions (adds a "solvent viscosity" term).
        *   **Giesekus Model:** Introduces a quadratic term in stress, allowing for shear-thinning and more realistic extensional viscosity. Equation: $\tau_\\sigma \frac{\mathcal{D}_\\sigma \\mathbf{\\sigma}'}{\mathcal{D} t} + \\mathbf{\\sigma}' + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu}(\\mathbf{\\sigma}' \\cdot \\mathbf{\\sigma}') = \\dots$
        *   **FENE-P Model:** (Finitely Extensible Non-linear Elastic - Peterlin) Models polymer dumbbells that have a maximum extension, leading to more realistic stress saturation.
*   **5. 1D Implementation:**
    *   Modify the 1D LNS solver from the previous series to easily switch between different stress evolution equations (UCM, Oldroyd-B, Giesekus).
    *   **Test Case:** Simulate a "start-up of shear flow" to demonstrate stress overshoot, a classic viscoelastic phenomenon.

**Notebook 2: Simulating Canonical Viscoelastic Flows**
*   **1. Extending the Solver to 2D for Complex Geometries.**
    *   Recap of the 2D FVM framework.
    *   Focus on implementing the different non-linear source terms from the Giesekus or FENE-P models.
*   **2. Simulation 1: Flow Through a 4:1 Planar Contraction.**
    *   A benchmark problem for viscoelasticity.
    *   **Analysis:** Visualize the stress fields. Show the development of large tensile stresses along the centerline and the formation of stable "corner vortices" whose size depends on the Deborah number ($De = \tau_\sigma U / L$), a key difference from Newtonian flows.
*   **3. Simulation 2: Flow Past a Confined Cylinder.**
    *   Another benchmark problem.
    *   **Analysis:** Show how viscoelasticity changes the wake structure behind the cylinder. Compare the drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency (Strouhal number) with the Newtonian case. Demonstrate the "drag reduction" or "drag enhancement" phenomena possible with viscoelastic fluids.

**Notebook 3: Elastic Turbulence and Multi-Phase LNS**
*   **1. Elastic Turbulence:**
    *   Introduce the concept of turbulence driven by elastic instabilities at very low Reynolds numbers (inertialess turbulence).
    *   **Hypothesis:** LNS, with its inherent elastic stress modeling, can capture the onset of elastic turbulence.
    *   **Simulation:** Conceptual simulation of a curved channel or Taylor-Couette flow at low Re and high Weissenberg number ($Wi = \tau_\sigma \dot{\gamma}$). Show the development of chaotic, time-dependent flow fields where inertia is negligible.
*   **2. Introduction to Multi-Phase LNS:**
    *   Discuss how the LNS framework can be extended to model complex multi-phase flows like suspensions or emulsions.
    *   The stress tensor is now a sum of solvent stress, particle stress, interfacial tension, etc.
    *   Each component can have its own dynamic evolution equation.
*   **3. Conceptual Model: A Dilute Suspension.**
    *   Outline a model where the total stress $\mathbf{\sigma}_{total} = \mathbf{\sigma}_{solvent} + \mathbf{\sigma}_{particle}$.
    *   The solvent might be Newtonian, while the particle stress $\mathbf{\sigma}_{particle}$ follows its own LNS-type relaxation equation that depends on particle concentration and orientation.
*   **4. Series Conclusion:**
    *   LNS is not just a high-frequency correction for simple fluids but the essential, unifying framework for complex fluid mechanics.
    *   It naturally incorporates the memory and non-linear rheology that define non-Newtonian materials, providing a clear path to predictive modeling of everything from polymer processing to biological fluids.

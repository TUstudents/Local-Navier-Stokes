## Physics Transformation Required

### Current Simplified Physics
```python
# WRONG - Zero physics coupling
q_NSF = 0.0  # Should be: -k * ‚àáT
s_NSF = 0.0  # Should be: 2Œº * ‚àáu

# Incomplete objective derivatives  
D_q_Dt = (q_new - q_old) / dt  # Missing: (u¬∑‚àá)q + (‚àá¬∑u)q - (‚àáu)^T¬∑q
D_s_Dt = (s_new - s_old) / dt  # Missing: (u¬∑‚àá)œÉ' - L¬∑œÉ' - œÉ'¬∑L^T
```

### Required Complete Physics
```python
# CORRECT - Physical gradient coupling
q_NSF = -K_THERM * compute_temperature_gradient(Q, dx)
s_NSF = 2.0 * MU_VISC * compute_velocity_gradient(Q, dx)

# Complete objective derivatives with tensor algebra
D_q_Dt = dq_dt + (u¬∑‚àá)q + (‚àá¬∑u)q - (‚àáu)^T¬∑q
D_s_Dt = ds_dt + (u¬∑‚àá)œÉ' - L¬∑œÉ' - œÉ'¬∑L^T  # UCM formulation
```

## Connection to Project Goals

This Phase 4 analysis directly addresses the foundational critique in `01_Foundation.md` by providing a systematic path to implement the complete Local Navier-Stokes physics that resolves the **"incompressibility paradox"** and **infinite speed of sound** issues identified in classical Navier-Stokes equations.

The implementation plan transforms our current simplified solver into a **complete physics platform** that fully realizes the theoretical potential of LNS equations while maintaining the robust numerical foundation established in Phases 1-3.

    "# Notebook 2: The Full 3D LNS System and its Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Series:** LNS: From Theory to High-Fidelity Turbulence Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In Notebook 1, we developed a robust 1D Local Navier-Stokes (LNS) solver by incorporating higher-order spatial reconstruction (MUSCL-Hancock) and a semi-implicit treatment for stiff relaxation source terms. This provided the necessary numerical foundation for accuracy and stability. Now, we take the most significant step in this series: extending our framework to a full three-dimensional (3D) system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This transition is not merely an addition of two more spatial dimensions; it introduces substantial new complexity, primarily in the tensor algebra required for the stress evolution and the structure of the 3D solver itself. This notebook will focus on:\n",
    "1.  **Deriving the complete 3D LNS equations:** We will explicitly write down the flux vectors and, critically, the full source terms for the deviatoric stress tensor using a proper objective time derivative (the Upper Convected Maxwell - UCM model will be our primary example).\n",
    "2.  **Outlining the 3D Finite Volume framework:** We will discuss the structure of a 3D solver on a Cartesian grid, including multi-dimensional flux calculations.\n",
    "3.  **Code Structure for a 3D Solver:** While a full, high-performance 3D implementation is beyond the scope of a single notebook document, we will provide a detailed Python code structure and key functions to illustrate how the 3D logic is implemented and how it builds upon our 1D work.\n",
    "4.  **Conceptual Validation:** We will discuss validation strategies for a 3D LNS code using simple test cases like the 3D advection of a vortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the architectural blueprint for the high-fidelity turbulence simulations planned for the remainder of the series."

    "## 1. The Full 3D LNS System Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D LNS system requires a state vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ that captures the full 3D velocity field, heat flux vector, and the symmetric deviatoric stress tensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "**State Vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ in 3D (13 variables):**\n",
    "To ensure a symmetric stress tensor $\\mathbf{\\sigma}'$ and enforce the traceless condition ($\text{tr}(\\mathbf{\\sigma}')=0$), we track 5 independent components. A common choice is:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{Q} = [\\rho, m_x, m_y, m_z, E_T, q_x, q_y, q_z, \\sigma'_{xx}, \\sigma'_{yy}, \\sigma'_{xy}, \\sigma'_{xz}, \\sigma'_{yz}]^T$$\n",
    "where $m_i = \\rho u_i$ and $\\sigma'_{zz}$ can be derived from the traceless condition: $\\sigma'_{zz} = -(\\sigma'_{xx} + \\sigma'_{yy})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system remains:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{Q}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}_z}{\\partial z} = \\mathbf{S}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\nabla \\mathbf{Q})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 3D Flux Vectors\n",
    "The flux vectors are direct extensions of the 2D case. For example, the x-flux vector $\\mathbf{F}_x$ is:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{F}_x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\rho u_x & (m_x) \\\\\n",
    "\\rho u_x^2 + p - \\sigma'_{xx} & (m_x) \\\\\n",

    "\\rho u_x u_z - \\sigma'_{xz} & (m_z) \\\\\n",
    "(E_T + p)u_x - (\\mathbf{\\sigma}' \\cdot \\mathbf{u})_x + q_x & (E_T) \\\\\n",
    "u_x q_x & (q_x) \\\\\n",

    "u_x \\sigma'_{yz} & (\\sigma'_{yz})\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "where $(\\mathbf{\\sigma}' \\cdot \\mathbf{u})_x = \\sigma'_{xx}u_x + \\sigma'_{xy}u_y + \\sigma'_{xz}u_z$. The flux vectors $\\mathbf{F}_y$ and $\\mathbf{F}_z$ follow by cyclic permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The 3D Source Term $\\mathbf{S}(\\mathbf{Q})$: The Crux of the Complexity\n",
    "The main challenge in 3D is the source term for the stress tensor components, which arises from the objective time derivative. We will use the **Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM)** model as our example. Its evolution equation is:\n",
    "$$\\tau_\\sigma \\frac{\\mathcal{D}_\\sigma \\mathbf{\\sigma}'}{\\mathcal{D} t} + \\mathbf{\\sigma}' = \\mathbf{\\sigma}'_{NSF}$$\n",
    "where the UCM objective derivative is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathcal{D}_\\sigma \\mathbf{\\sigma}'}{\\mathcal{D} t} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{\\sigma}'}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{\\sigma}' - \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\sigma}' - \\mathbf{\\sigma}' \\cdot \\mathbf{L}^T$$\n",
    "and $\\mathbf{L} = \\nabla \\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity gradient tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging for our conservation law form $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma'_{ij}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\sigma'_{ij}) = S_{\\sigma'_{ij}}$, the source term for a component $\\sigma'_{ij}$ is:\n",
    "$$S_{\\sigma'_{ij}} = \\underbrace{\\sigma'_{ij} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})}_{\\text{from advection}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_\\sigma} \\left( \\underbrace{\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\sigma}' + \\mathbf{\\sigma}' \\cdot \\mathbf{L}^T}_{\\text{UCM stretching}} - \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\tau_\\sigma}(\\mathbf{\\sigma}' - \\mathbf{\\sigma}'_{NSF})}_{\\text{relaxation}} \\right)_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",

These must be calculated accurately at each cell center, typically using finite differences on neighboring cell-averaged data, requiring a stencil of 27 cells for a central difference scheme.\n",

Each processor handles a subdomain and communicates boundary information (ghost cell data) with its neighbors."
